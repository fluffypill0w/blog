Hi there, I'm Megan. I analyze and experiment with tech, particularly blockchains and all things security-related. I live somewhere between Barcelona and a mess of (human) languages in my head, and I love to witness the terrible beauty of this life and try my best to reflect it back in all I do.



My favorite animal is the octopus. Here are some octopus facts for you:

- Octopus have a [decentralized brain](https://www.psychologytoday.com/intl/blog/science-and-philosophy/202003/the-octopus-and-the-unity-consciousness), with [more than half of their neurons located within their arms](https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2010/10/thinking-like-an-octopus/).

- Octopuses have [three hearts](https://www.sciencefocus.com/nature/why-does-an-octopus-have-more-than-one-heart/).

- The octopus has [the highest brain-to-body ratio of all invertebrates](https://www.nhm.ac.uk/discover/octopuses-keep-surprising-us-here-are-eight-examples-how.html).

- Octopuses have a [non-somatotopic internal mapping of their bodies](https://www.cell.com/current-biology/fulltext/S0960-9822(09)01546-2?_returnURL=https%3A%2F%2Flinkinghub.elsevier.com%2Fretrieve%2Fpii%2FS0960982209015462%3Fshowall%3Dtrue).
